This is a simple Vue.js front-end built on top of the hard work done by the font
creators and patorjk who wrote the [figlet.js](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js) font parser.

## Build basics

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
