# ascii-today

This is a simple front-end built on top of the hard work done by the original font
creators and patorjk who wrote the figlet.js font parser

## Build basics

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
